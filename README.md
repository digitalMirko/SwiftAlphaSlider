# SwiftAlphaSlider
Swift - Swift Alpha Slider - Demo 2 of 30

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.4 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to use the swift UISlider in code to create a Alpha Slider app.

When the user clicks the icon they are taken right into the app. They are greeted with the title on top 'Swift Alpha Slider'.
Then in the middle is a label 'Alpha Slider' with a slider right below. When the user slides the slider either to the left or to
the right and the alpha level changes on the text right above. The alpha level starts at 50%(.5) because the slider is in the middle.
When the slider is moved all the way to the right the alpha level is 1 and you can see the text 100%(1) full in black color. But
when you slide the slider all the way to the right the alpha level is 0%(0) and the text is invisible.
